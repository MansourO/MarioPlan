      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

Download
Materialize comes in two different forms. You can select which version you want depending on your preference and
expertise. To start using Materialize, all you have to do is download one of the options below.

Materialize
This is the standard version that comes with both the minified and unminified CSS and JavaScript files. This option
requires little to no setup. Use this if you are unfamiliar with Sass.

Sass
This version contains the source SCSS files. By choosing this version you have more control over which components to
include. You will need a Sass compiler if you choose this option.


CDN
You can find all the versions of the CDN at cdnjs.
